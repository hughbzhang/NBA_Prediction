I used a script "for file in DATA/*; do ./parser.sh $file; done" to populate the parsed data

Used cut to get the columns then manipulated data in Google Sheets to get the Charts.
Turns out that WinnerPoints, LoserPoints, and AllPoints are all normally distributed. Aggregating two normal distributions with different means (Winners + Losers) usually gets a bimodal distribution, but these overlapped a significant amount so the middle became the new peak. I don't know what to say about this though.

Notably, point differential is not normal in any way. It is right skew. Heavily. With the peak difference around 7 points (3-4 plays) which is NOT trivial.

Note: I decided against using play by play. It is too hard. I don't have the time or the power. I will take into account variance though.

538 data is hard to scrape. Determined by sampling though that their accuracy is around 70%. Took around 150 samples so 10% of population. My current model is around 65-66% accuracy just adjusting carry over and K. Still need to do (possibly) dates and home/away. Also 538 just uses the elo model straight from wikipedia. Denom is 400. K is 20. Home is 100. Carryover is a really high 75%. Margin of victory is really odd.

TODO: Try a linear model? What does that even mean? If that is interesting (or even if it is not) do a topo sort of the complete graph and see what it shows.


Brier beats logLoss by ~10 predictions. LogLoss beats Elo by ~10 predictions, even though my genetic algorithm doesn't take into account home/away yet, but Elo does. Still work to do, but it seems brier is the continuous loss function closest to what I care about 1-round(probability). Logloss penalizes black swans a lot but I really don't care about that. For my purposes a close miss and a way off are pretty much the same when executing.

Dude, problem though. Your brier right now is like .21, which is kind of scary bad, since 50% guessing is .25 brier. IDK. Keep going.
