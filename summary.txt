I did the initial coding and stuff. Pretty much found a website with all basketball data. Learned sed and vim search and replace to manipulate it and then ran an elo system on it. Achieved around 65% accuracy (not bad at all). Moneyline bets for NBA are difficult have data on, so maybe either switch to MLB (hard to find game data) or keep searching for NBA moneyline data.
